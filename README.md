# Welcome

Welcome to my final project!

# About

This is a web app made with the intention of creating and finding out about events. The initial idea was for beach cleanups but why limit it to solely the beach? Why not parks, lakes, sidewalks, downtowns? This could be used for anything it could easily evolve to more than just an events site.

## What went in...

The app is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS using node, express, and react. The frontend and backend API are deployed and hosted using Firebase. Authentication is handled through Firebase and the app is connected to a Firestore database. Ant Design was used for styling and additional components.

You can access this app from anywhere that has internet access, so feel free to use it on desktop, tablet, phone, etc. but at this point in time it is best viewed via desktop.


# How To

The app was purposely made to be fairly simple to use. 

When you go to the domain for the first time you will be presented with a homepage that welcomes you and describes the app.

In order to use the app, first log in or sign up with username/password or Google login. Both are secure and your password will be encrypted and never revealed. If you log in with Google, however, you will be shown more personalization, as your Google metadata (such as your name, email, user photo, etc) can be imported and shown throughout the site.

After logging in, you will be redirected to a new homepage that displays all posted events. You can click on the name of an event or the button titled, "More", to see more details about the event. 

Click the "Create new event" in order to fill out a form and create a new event.

Click the Profile page button to see a simple page showing the events you've created and some basic information pertaining to you such as your linked email address.

From your profile page you can create events, delete events, or edit them with the trash icon. 

## By the way 

You will notice after clicking on an individual event to see the event details that you can only edit or delete your own events and and can't alter others' events. 

Log out when finished, but don't feel like you have to, your log in is saved in persistence so you won't have to log back in the next time you visit from the same browser.

Remember, you can access this app from anywhere that you can access the internet, so create events, share them with friends, and lets try and make the world a better place.

Enjoy.
